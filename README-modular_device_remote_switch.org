** Assembly Instructions

- Choose 0.125 inch expandable sleeving color and cut to 18 inches.
- Expand sleeving and slip over the two pendant switch wires, pushing it over
  the wires until the sleeve is within 0.5 inches from the switch.
- Slip one 0.25 inch x 1 inch heat shrink tube over the wires and expanded
  sleeveing and push it as close to the switch as possible so it is covering
  one fraying end of the sleeving.
- Slip another 0.25 inch x 1 inch heat shrink tube over the wires and expanded
  sleeving and push it until the center of the heat shrink tube is about 1.5
  inches from the ends of the switch wires so it is covering the second
  fraying end of the sleeving.
- Use a heat gun to shrink both heat shrink tubes on the sleeving and switch
  wires.
- Use wire cutter to trim the two switch wires to the same length.
- Use wire stripper to remove 0.1 inches of insulation from each of the two
  switch wires.
- Use crimp tool to crimp one socket onto the end of each switch wire, using a
  total of two sockets.
- Insert each of the two sockets into one receptacle connector, either wire
  can be placed into the pin 1 position, the placement position is not
  imporant.
- Cut the 2-conductor cable to the desired length and remove 2 inches of the
  cable jacket from each of the two ends of the cable.
- Slip a 0.25 inch x 1 inch heat shrink tube over each end of the cable jacket
  and use a heat gun to shrink it into place.
- Use wire cutter to trim the two cable wires to the same length on each side
  of the cable.
- Use wire stripper to remove 0.1 inches of insulation from each end of the
  two wires in the cable.
- One one end of the cable, use crimp tool to crimp one socket onto the end of
  each the two cable wires, using a total of two sockets.
- Insert each of the two sockets into one receptacle connector, either wire
  can be placed into the pin 1 position, the placement position is not
  imporant.
- One the other end of the cable, use crimp tool to crimp one pin onto the end
  of each the two cable wires, using a total of two pins.
- Insert each of the two pins into one plug connector, either wire
  can be placed into the pin 1 position, the placement position is not
  imporant.
- Insert the receptacle connector attached to the switch into the plug
  connector on the cable.
- Insert the receptacle connector attached to the cable into a two-pin BTN
  connector on the modular device.
